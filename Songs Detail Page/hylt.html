                    BLACKPINK in your area
                    <br>
                    보란 듯이 무너졌어
                    <br>
                    바닥을 뚫고 저 지하까지
                    <br>
                    옷 끝자락 잡겠다고
                    <br>
                    저 높이 두 손을 뻗어 봐도
                    <br>
                    다시 캄캄한 이곳에 light up the sky
                    <br>
                    네 두 눈을 보며, I'll kiss you bye
                    <br>
                    실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까
                    <br>
                    이제 너희, 하나, 둘, 셋
                    <br>
                    Ha, how you like that? (Ooh)
                    <br>
                    You gon' like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that
                    <br>
                    How you like that? (Bada-bing, bada-boom-boom-boom)
                    <br>
                    How you like that, that-that-that-that, that-that-that-that?
                    <br>
                    Now look at you, now look at me (uh)
                    <br>
                    Look at you, now look at me (uh)
                    <br>
                    Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
                    <br>

                    Look at you, now look at me (uh)
                    <br>
                    Look at you, now look at me, how you like that?
                    <br>
                    Your girl need it all and that's a hunnid
                    <br>
                    백 개 중에 백, 내 몫을 원해
                    <br>
                    Karma come and get some
                    <br>
                    딱하지만 어쩔 수 없잖아
                    <br>
                    What's up? I'm right back (right back)
                    <br>
                    방아쇠를 cock back (cock back)
                    <br>
                    Plain Jane get hijacked, don't like me?
                    <br>
                    Then tell me how you like that, like that?
                    <br>
                    더 캄캄한 이곳에 shine like the stars
                    <br>
                    그 미소를 띠며, I'll kiss you goodbye
                    <br>
                    실컷 비웃어라 꼴 좋으니까

                    <br>
                    날개 잃은 채로 추락했던 날
                    <br>
                    어두운 나날 속에 갇혀 있던 날
                    <br>
                    그때쯤에 넌 날 끝내야 했어
                    <br>
                    Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
                    <br>
                    Yeah-eh-eh-eh
                    <br>
                    Bring out your boss, bitch
                    <br>
                    Yeah-eh-eh-eh
                    <br>
