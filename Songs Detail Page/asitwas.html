                    Gravity's holdin' me back
                    <br>
                    I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
                    <br>
                    Why don't we leave it at that?
                    <br>
                    Nothin' to say
                    <br>
                    When everything gets in the way
                    <br>
                    Seems you cannot be replaced
                    <br>
                    And I'm the one who will stay, oh
                    <br>
                    In this world, it's just us
                    <br>
                    You know it's not the same as it was

                    <br>
                    Answer the phone
                    <br>
                    "Harry, you're no good alone
                    <br>
                    Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
                    <br>
                    What kind of pills are you on?"
                    <br>
                    Ringin' the bell
                    <br>
                    And nobody's comin' to help
                    <br>
                    Your daddy lives by himself
                    <br>
                    He just wants to know that you're well, oh

                    Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
                    <br>
                    I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
                    <br>
                    Leave America, two kids follow her
                    <br>
                    I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
