                <p>I hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
                    <br>
                    How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
                    <br>
                    Just what you wanted
                    <br>
                    Look at you, cool guy, you got it
                    <br>
                    I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
                    <br>
                    Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
                    <br>
                    I loved you truly
                    <br>
                    You gotta laugh at the stupidity
                    <br>
                    'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
                    <br>
                    But you make the worst one look fine
                    <br>
                    I should've known it was strange
                    <br>
                    You only come out at night
                    <br>
                    I used to think I was smart
                    <br>
                    But you made me look so naive
                    <br>
                    The way you sold me for parts
                    <br>
                    As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
                    <br>
                    Bloodsucker, fame-fucker
                    <br>
                    Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
                    <br>
                    And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
                    <br>
                    You called them crazy, god, I hate the way I called them crazy too
                    <br>
                    You're so convincing
                    <br>
                    How do you lie without flinching?
                    <br>
                    (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
                    <br>
                    Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill
                    <br>
                    Can't figure out just how you do it, and god knows I never will
                    <br>
                    Went for me, and not her
                    <br>
                    'Cause girls your age know better
                    <br>
                    I've made some real big mistakes
                    <br>
                    But you make the worst one look fine
                    <br>
                    I should've known it was strange

                    As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

                    Bloodsucker, fame-fucker
                    <br>
                    Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
                    <br>
                    You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
                    <br>
                    You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart
                    <br>
                    I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't
                    <br>
                    'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand
                    <br>
                    I've made some real big mistakes
                    <br>
                    But you make the worst one look fine
                    <br>
