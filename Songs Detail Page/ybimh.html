                    Come stop your crying
                    <br>
                    It will be alright
                    <br>
                    Just take my hand
                    <br>
                    Hold it tight
                    <br>
                    I will protect you
                    <br>
                    From all around you
                    <br>
                    I will be here
                    <br>
                    Don't you cry
                    <br>
                    For one so small
                    <br>
                    You seem so strong
                    <br>
                    My arms will hold you
                    <br>
                    Keep you safe and warm
                    <br>
                    This bond between us
                    <br>
                    Can't be broken
                    <br>
                    I will be here
                    <br>
                    Don't you cry
                    <br>
                    Cause you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    Yes, you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    From this day on
                    <br>
                    Now and forever more
                    <br>
                    Yes, you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    No matter what they say
                    <br>
                    You'll be here in my heart
                    <br>
                    Always
                    <br>
                    Why can't they understand the way we feel
                    <br>
                    They just don't trust what they can't explain
                    <br>
                    I know we're different, but deep inside us
                    <br>
                    We're not that different at all
                    <br>
                    And you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    Yes, you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    From this day on
                    <br>
                    Now and forever more
                    <br>
                    Don't listen to them
                    <br>
                    'Cause what do they know
                    <br>
                    We need each other, to have, to hold
                    <br>
                    They'll see in time, I know
                    <br>
                    When destiny calls you, you must be strong
                    <br>
                    I may not be with you
                    <br>
                    But you've got to hold on
                    <br>
                    They'll see in time, I know
                    <br>
                    We'll show them together
                    <br>
                    'Cause you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    Yes, you'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    From this day on
                    <br>
                    Now and forever more
                    <br>
                    You'll be in my heart
                    <br>
                    No matter what they say
                    <br>
                    You'll be here in my heart
                    <br>
                    Always
                    <br>
                    Always
                    <br>
                    Just look over your shoulder
                    <br>
                    Just look over your shoulder
                    <br>
                    Just look over your shoulder
                    <br>
                    Just look over your shoulder
                    <br>
                    I'll be there
                    <br>
                    Always
