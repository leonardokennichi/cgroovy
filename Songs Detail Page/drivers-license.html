                <p>
                    I got my driver's license last week
                    <br>
                    Just like we always talked about
                    <br>
                    'Cause you were so excited for me
                    <br>
                    To finally drive up to your house
                    <br>
                    But today I drove through the suburbs
                    <br>
                    Cryin' 'cause you weren't around
                    <br>
                    And you're probably with that blonde girl
                    <br>
                    Who always made me doubt
                    <br>
                    She's so much older than me
                    <br>
                    She's everything I'm insecure about
                    <br>
                    Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                    <br>
                    'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
                    <br>
                    And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
                    <br>
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    <br>
                    Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    <br>
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    <br>
                    And all my friends are tired
                    <br>
                    Of hearing how much I miss you, but
                    <br>
                    I kinda feel sorry for them
                    <br>
                    'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
                    <br>
                    Today I drove through the suburbs
                    <br>
                    And pictured I was driving home to you
                    <br>
                    And I know we weren't perfect
                    <br>
                    But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
                    <br>
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    <br>
                    I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    <br>
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    <br>
                    Red lights, stop signs
                    <br>
                    I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
                    <br>
                    Can't drive past the places we used to go to
                    <br>
                    'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
                    <br>
                    Sidewalks we crossed
                    <br>
                    I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
                    <br>
                    Over all the noise
                    <br>
                    God, I'm so blue, know we're through
                    <br>
                    But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
                    <br>
                    I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
                    <br>
                    And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
                    <br>
                    'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
                    <br>
                    'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
                    <br>
                    Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
