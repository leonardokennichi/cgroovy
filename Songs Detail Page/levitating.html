                    If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
                    <br>
                    And I can take you for a ride
                    <br>
                    I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
                    <br>
                    Where the music don't stop for life
                    <br>
                    Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
                    <br>
                    Shining just the way I like
                    <br>
                    If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
                    <br>
                    You met me at the perfect time
                    <br>
                    You want me, I want you, baby
                    <br>
                    My sugarboo, I'm levitating
                    <br>
                    The Milky Way, we're renegading
                    <br>
                    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
                    <br>
                    I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
                    <br>
                    I need you all night, come on, dance with me
                    <br>
                    I'm levitating
                    <br>
                    You, moonlight, you're my starlight (you're the moonlight)

                    <br>
                    I'm levitating
                    <br>
                    I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
                    <br>
                    I see us written in the stars
                    <br>
                    We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never, baby
                    <br>
                    Nothing's ever, ever too far
                    <br>
                    Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
                    <br>
                    Shining just the way we are
                    <br>
                    I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
                    <br>
                    But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
                    <br>
                    You want me, I want you, baby
