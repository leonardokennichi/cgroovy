                    Oh, ey
                    <br>
                    You don't know babe
                    <br>
                    When you hold me
                    <br>
                    And kiss me slowly
                    <br>
                    It's the sweetest thing
                    <br>
                    And it don't change
                    <br>
                    If I had it my way
                    <br>
                    You would know that you are
                    <br>
                    You're the coffee that I need in the morning
                    <br>
                    You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
                    <br>
                    Won't you give yourself to me
                    <br>
                    Give it all, oh
                    <br>
                    I just wanna see
                    <br>
                    I just wanna see how beautiful you are
                    <br>
                    You know that I see it
                    <br>
                    I know you're a star
                    <br>
                    Where you go I'll follow
                    <br>
                    No matter how far
                    <br>
                    If life is a movie
                    <br>
                    Oh you're the best part, oh
                    <br>
                    You're the best part, oh
                    <br>
                    Best part
                    <br>
                    It's this sunrise
                    <br>
                    And those brown eyes, yes
                    <br>
                    You're the one that I desire
                    <br>
                    When we wake up
                    <br>
                    And then we make love
                    <br>
                    It makes me feel so nice
                    <br>
                    You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
                    <br>
                    You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
                    <br>
                    You're the sunshine on my life
                    <br>
                    I just wanna see how beautiful you are
                    <br>
                    You know that I see it
                    <br>
                    I know you're a star
                    <br>
