                    Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
                    <br>
                    Get some air now, let yo edge out
                    <br>
                    Too soon, I spoke
                    <br>
                    You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
                    <br>
                    I need rest now, got me bummed out
                    <br>
                    You so, you so, you
                    <br>
                    Baby, baby, babe
                    <br>
                    I've been on my empty mind shit
                    <br>
                    I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
                    <br>
                    I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
                    <br>
                    You don't care
                    <br>
                    Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
                    <br>
                    Tryna make sense of loose change
                    <br>
                    Got me a war in my mind
                    <br>
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
                    <br>
                    Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
                    <br>
                    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
                    <br>
                    Still wanna try, still believe in
                    <br>
                    Good days, good days, always
                    <br>
                    Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
                    <br>
                    Good day living in my mind
                    <br>
                    Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
                    <br>
                    I disappear if you let me
                    <br>
                    Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
                    <br>
                    Feelin' like Jericho
                    <br>
                    Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
                    <br>
                    Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
                    <br>
                    Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
                    <br>
                    Know you like that shit
                    <br>
                    Can't groove it, ba-baby
                    <br>
                    Heavy on my empty mind shit
                    <br>
                    I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
                    <br>
                    Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
                    <br>
                    You don't care
                    <br>
                    Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
                    <br>
                    Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
                    <br>
                    Good day living in my mind
                    <br>
                    Gotta get right
                    <br>
                    Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
                    <br>
                    I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
                    <br>
                    I choose not to respond
                    <br>
                    I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
                    <br>
                    Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
                    <br>
                    (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
                    <br>
                    Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now
                    <br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
                    <br>
                    You've been making me feel like I'm
                    <br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
